# NJUPT-login

A messy NJUPT campus network login script by William Wei. Python noob's first try.

[中文](https://github.com/WiIIiamWei/NJUPT-login/blob/main/README.md)

## How to use

**! WARNING: This script will generate a config.bin file in the current directory to store your login info. Please do not delete or share this file, as it will lead to your password being leaked!**

You can find executable files generated by `pyinstaller` on the Release page, or download the source code and run it directly (requires module `requests`).

For easy identification, the executable program uses the logo of NJUPT. The use is unauthorized and is for academic purposes only. Please do not use it for commercial purposes.

It is recommended to put the executable in a single folder and create a link on Desktop or Start folder for auto login (you may also try scheduled task).
